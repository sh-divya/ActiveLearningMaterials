# Perov-5

Perov-5 contains 18928 perovskite materials, which share similar structure, but has different composition. There are 56 elements and all materials have 5 atoms in the unit cell.

## What is in the dataset?

Perovskite is a class of materials that share a similar structure and have the general chemical formula ABX3. The ideal perovskites have a cubic structure, where the site A atom sits at a corner position, the site B atom sits at a body centered position and site X atoms sit at face centered positions. Most structures in Perov-5 will signficantly deviate from the ideal cubic structure because the distorted structure has a lower energy.

## Stability of curated materials

All 18928 materials in the original database are included. All materials are at local energy minimum after DFT relaxation. A significant portion of the materials are not thermodynamically stable, i.e., they will decompose to nearby phases and cannot be synthesized.
